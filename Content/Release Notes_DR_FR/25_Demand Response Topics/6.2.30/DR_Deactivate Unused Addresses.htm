        <h1>Deactivate Unused Addresses</h1>
        <p>While working with RouteMatch, many agencies typically build up a large amount of unused addresses that never have trips assigned to them. Having a high number of these unneeded addresses can lead to errors if a user happens to select one of them by mistake. The Addresses module now contains a feature that allows you to bulk deactivate these addresses at the same time.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #20b0e6;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">The system prevents you from removing any addresses that have trips associated to them in the past or future. This is necessary to prevent errors.</p>
        <h2>How to Deactivate Unused Addresses</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Addresses module, click the <b>Unused</b> button on the toolbar.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Demand Response/6.2.30/Unused Addresses Toolbar Button.png" class="ImageStep" />
        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>On the screen that appears, enter or select the criteria of the address you would like to remove and then click the <b>Search and Return</b> button. For example, if you would like to deactivate any unused medical addresses, you can search for the "Medical" address type.</li>
        </ol>

        <ol MadCap:continue="true">

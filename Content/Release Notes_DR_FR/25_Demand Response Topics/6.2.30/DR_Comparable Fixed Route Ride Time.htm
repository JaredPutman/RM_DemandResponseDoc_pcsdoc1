        <h1>Comparable Fixed Route Ride Time</h1>
        <p>Many agencies are required by ADA&#160;regulations to avoid booking excessively long paratransit trips for their customers. This is done by comparing the trip's travel time to a similar fixed route trip. For example, a 1-hour travel time for a 5-mile paratransit trip may seem excessive. However, if the same trip takes an hour using the fixed route system, it is comparable, not excessive.</p>
        <p>In order to support this requirement, RouteMatch displays the comparable estimated fixed route trip distance and time in the Trips module when booking a new trip. Your staff can then compare these values with the Trip Estimate field to determine whether or not the paratransit trip's time or distance are unreasonably long.</p>

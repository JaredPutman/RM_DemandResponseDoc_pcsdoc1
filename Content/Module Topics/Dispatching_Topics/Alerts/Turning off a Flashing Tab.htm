        <p>A flashing tab will continue to flash until the view has been refreshed and the condition is no longer valid. Either the formatting option that is causing the flashing is set to no longer flash the tab (flash is turned off on the Formatting Condition Properties screen) or the user must manually set the flash to stop. If the tab is manually set to stop, it will start flashing again if the view is refreshed and the condition for flashing still exists.</p>
        <p>Follow the procedure below to manually turn off a flashing tab:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Right-click on any tab at the bottom of the Dispatching window. If more than one tab is flashing, a pop up menu displays so that you can select which tab to turn off. If only one tab is flashing, that will be the only menu choice. If more than one tab is flashing, there will also be a menu option to turn flashing off for all tabs.</li>
            <li>Select an option from the menu, shown below, to turn off the flashing tab(s).</li>
        </ol>

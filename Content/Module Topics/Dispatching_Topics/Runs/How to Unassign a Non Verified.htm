            <li>Click the <b>Run Management</b> button on the toolbar. The Run Management screen displays. This screen has three panes. The top, left pane consists of unassigned runs grouped by Service. The bottom, left pane lists unassigned drivers. The right pane lists vehicles and assigned runs.</li>
            <li>Select a run in the right pane. The Unassign button becomes active.</li>
            <li>Click the button to unassign the run and all the trips associated with it. If a red check appears on the run icon, that means the run has already been verified and cannot be unassigned.</li>

        <h1>How to Mark a Trip as a No Show or a Cancellation</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the desired data view, enter a Customer Name in the search field, and click the <b>Search</b> button or expand the grouping in the data view to display the customer trips.</li>
            <li>Locate the trip in the Dispatching grid and check the checkbox in either the <b>No Show</b> or <b>Cancellation</b> column for that trip. Once you click outside of the No Show/Cancellation field, the system will check for trips that are chained to the trip you just marked.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="noteMiddle">Trips chained to the marked trip will display in a pop-up, as shown below. Trips completed or that have an MDC status later than "Trip Scheduled" will not be considered.</p>

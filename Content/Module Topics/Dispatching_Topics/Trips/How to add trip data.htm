        <p>The data you can enter on the <b>Quick Lookup</b> dialog depends on the custom fields your agency uses in the Trips module, and which fields your administrator makes visible through the Settings module. Refer to the section, Configuring Quick Lookup below for more information.</p>

            <li>Search for a trip using one of the search criteria. Notice that the system attempts to ‘guess’ the type of search you want to perform based on what you entered, so you may not need to change your selection.</li>
            <li>Select the trip. Once the trip has been selected, you can edit the fields at the bottom of the dialog depending on your agency’s settings. By default, you can at least cancel the trip, or mark it as a no show. You can also enter a no show reason or trip comment.</li>
            <li>If data has already been entered for a trip, you can edit what was previously saved.</li>
            <li>Once changes are made, click <b>Save </b>to save the trip data.</li>

        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>In the Customer Select (Required) field, search for and select or enter a customer from the drop-down list. You can search by Last Name, Full Name, SSN, Phone Number or Customer ID.</li>
            <li>For the selected customer, accept the given address or choose a Pickup Address (Required) by searching for it using the Search button. Refer to the section Search for an Address in the Addresses chapter for further information on using the search feature. You may also select the Favorite Trips button to access the Favorite Trips screen to select a trip option. Favorite trips are set up on the Customers window – Favorite Trips tab, but in order to set them up there must be Favorite Trip Categories added by an Administrator in the Settings window – Customer Options.</li>
            <li>Choose a Dropoff Address (Required) by searching for it using the Search button. The same search criteria apply here.</li>
            <li>Select a Timing Preference (Required). This would indicate whether the trip was a pickup, dropoff, or a pickup with an appointment time.</li>
            <li>Enter the Request Time (Required).</li>
            <li>The Appt. Time field only becomes active if the Timing Preference of Pickup with an Appointment Time was selected. Enter the Appt. Time, if requested.</li>
            <li>In the Schedule Information block, select an option from the Select Vehicle / Run For field. Options include: Day of, Day before, Day after. If the field is set to Day of, you will get a list of vehicles and runs available for the "day of" the trip date. If you set the field to Day before you will get a list of vehicles and runs available on the day before the trip date. Selecting Day after creates a list of vehicles and runs for the day after the trip date.</li>
            <li>Choose to schedule the trip to a specific Vehicle Or Run. This list is populated with data for the date indicated by the Select Vehicle / Run For field.</li>
            <li>Indicate the Pickup Time and the Dropoff Time in the designated fields.</li>
            <li>Select a Funding Source (Required) from the drop-down list. If you need to associate a new funding source for the customer click <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Dispatching_Screenshots/How to add a trip_2.png" style="width: 10px;height: 10px;" /> (ellipsis button) to display the Customer Eligibility window.</li>
            <li>Select an Override (Required) from the drop-down list. An override works in conjunction with the funding source when calculating billing and could be, for example, an alternate type of customer pay like cash or a pass card. In Verification, when the RBE calculation is performed, the override is computed to be the actual expected customer pay.</li>
            <li>Enter or select information for the other optional fields according to your agencies policies.</li>
            <li>Once you have entered data, click one of the following buttons:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Save and Continue</b> – to save the data and continue entering information on the Add New Trip window.</li>
            <li><b>Save and Return</b> – Save the data. The Add New Trip window closes and the trip appears highlighted on the Dispatching window.</li>
            <li><b>Save and Create Return Trip</b> – Save the trip as shown and then create a return trip by swapping the addresses so that the pickup is now the dropoff address and the dropoff is now the pickup address.</li>
            <li><b>Cancel and Return </b>– Return to the Dispatching window without saving any of the entered data.</li>
        </ul>

            <p>Dispatchers monitor their agency’s day-off operations using Data Views, which display in a grid on the main part of the screen. This grid constantly refreshes throughout the day in order to provide up-to-date information. The dispatcher can then effectively perform the various other tasks their job entails.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>Data Views are highly configurable. Your agency has the ability to decide which fields to display in the grid and their order. You also have several options for filtering and formatting the data. Plus, you can set up multiple data views to help deal with specific situations (excessively late trips, for instance).</p>
            <p>You can find full instructions on how to configure data views in Appendix A of this guide. Please contact RouteMatch support if you require assistance.</p>

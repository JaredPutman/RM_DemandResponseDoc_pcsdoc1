        <p>Like the ETA (slack) column, the Current Manifest Slack calculation is the difference between the Stop Time and the ETA (actual) time. Because it is reported at the vehicle level, however, it shows only the slack to the next uncompleted stop (and not for any other stops). Therefore, the same value displays in this column for each row belonging to a vehicle.</p>
        <p>This column indicates if the driver is ahead (positive number), or behind (negative number). This column is crucial when creating a "vehicle lateness" data view. This view is described below allows dispatchers to instantly know when any vehicle is going to be more than a set amount of time late for their next stop.</p>

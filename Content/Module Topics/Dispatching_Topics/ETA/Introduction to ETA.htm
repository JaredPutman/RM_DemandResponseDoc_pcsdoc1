        <p>ETA is a feature of the Dispatching module that displays the estimated time of arrival for all stops, taking into account stop times, breaks, and garage times. This data is viewed on the dispatching grid, making it easy for dispatchers to incorporate this functionality into their routine.</p>
        <p>This feature is used to see how close to "on time" vehicles are running through their schedules in the course of the day, allowing dispatchers to make adjustments to the schedules accordingly. When changes are made, ETA makes new calculations immediately, showing the dispatcher how the changes affect other trips later in the day.</p>
        <p>When used in conjunction with vehicles equipped with mobile-data devices, the incoming real-time data feed causes ETA values to adjust automatically as the trips are processed by the drivers and/or when periodic GPS information is received. Without mobile-data devices, ETA works only when manual trip edits are made by Dispatchers.</p>
        <p>There are several reasons you would want to use this feature:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You want to be able to tell your clients with greater accuracy if their vehicle will arrive in their expected window.</li>
            <li>You want to keep track of how close to schedule your drivers are running.</li>
            <li>You want to know when you can slip trips into a current schedule without throwing off the trips that come after.</li>
            <li>You want to be alerted when any vehicle is over a certain number of minutes late. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Using ETA may require you to adjust your current procedures, but not in any way that would slow you down. Please read through this document to see how using the ETA functionality can enhance your current workflow.</p>

            <p class="noteMiddle">ETA was designed to help you determine the current and future status of the trips on your dispatching grid. It is not intended to be a tool that you should use to keep track of completed trips. ETA calculations posted for trips that have already been completed do not update the ETA (actual) column and may confuse or mislead your dispatching staff.</p>
            <p class="noteBottom">You should always judge your ETA calculations based on what you see on your trips in the future.</p>

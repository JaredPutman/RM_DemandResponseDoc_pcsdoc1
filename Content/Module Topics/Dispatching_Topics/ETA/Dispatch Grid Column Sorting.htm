        <p>The rows of the Dispatch grid represent your vehicle manifest(s), where the stops are ordered by Stop Time. If you make a change to trip 1, then trip 2 and beyond stay where they are in terms of Stop Time, with trip 1 inserted in its new position. Future stop times are not updated this is because changes made to Stop Time go out to the MDC, so you don’t want an update to one trip that is "running late" to immediately update all later trips.</p>
        <p>Before ETA functionality was available in RouteMatch, you would normally sort your dispatching grid by Stop Time. While this is an accurate view of your manifest’s stop order, it can be confusing as you make changes that affect more than one stop because you have no indication of the effects your changes are having on the overall schedule of the manifest.</p>
        <p>When using ETA functionality, it is recommended you sort your grid by the ETA (actual) column. This allows you to easily see what is happening to your manifests as you make changes and/or real-time status and location updates occur. You can then choose to make further adjustments (edits to Stop Times, trip moves to other vehicles, etc.) to account for problems and/or to use slack time that may exist.&#160;</p>
        <p>You can properly inform a rider who calls in, wanting to know if their pickup is on time, and/or how much longer it will be before they are picked up, by conveying the value currently displayed in the ETA column. Remember that the ETA column shows if a driver is running behind, but not if they are running ahead.</p>
        <p>Note the two kinds of use and the corresponding columns provided. Drivers are graded against the current Stop Time; customers grade their experience against the promised early/late window. ETA (actual) and ETA (slack) are useful in evaluating a driver’s performance. ETA and ETA (early/late) give the customer’s point-of-view.</p>

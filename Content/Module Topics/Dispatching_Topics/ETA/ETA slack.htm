        <p>ETA (actual) is the time that RSE says you will arrive at the stop; Stop Time is the time the driver is trying to get there. ETA (slack) is the difference between the two, and indicates if the driver is ahead (positive number) or behind (negative number). Use this column to determine if you can add trips at a particular point in your schedule, without impacting future stops. Note that if the driver is still within the window, the driver is not early or late, only ahead or behind.</p>

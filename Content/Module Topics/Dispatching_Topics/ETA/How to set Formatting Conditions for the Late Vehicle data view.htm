        <h1>How to set Formatting Conditions for the Late Vehicle data view</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>While on the Data View Properties screen, click Add in the Formatting Conditions section.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Dispatching_Screenshots/Formatting Condition Properties.png" class="ImageStep" />
        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Select Current Manifest Slack in the Field Name drop-down list.</li>
            <li>Select Less Than Or Equal To in the Condition drop-down. This is due to the fact that lateness is determined by the amount of slack in the schedule. A negative number indicates more lateness and mathematically, the later number is "less than" a number that is not as late.</li>
            <li>Enter an amount in the Value[1] field. This indicates the number of minutes you consider a vehicle late. In our example, we use -21.</li>
            <li>Select the Flash Tab option to have the tab flash when a new item is added. This is useful when you are viewing a different tab and want to be alerted when a vehicle is added to this view.</li>
            <li>Optionally, you can add additional formatting conditions to differentiate different levels of "lateness" in your view. For example, if you use -21 for a late vehicle to appear on the view, you can add -42 for a "very late" and make the item bold on the list.</li>
            <li>Click Save and Return to return to the Data View Properties dialog.</li>

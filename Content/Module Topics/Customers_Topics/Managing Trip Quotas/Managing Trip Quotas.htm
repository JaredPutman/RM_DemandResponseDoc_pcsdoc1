        <h1><a name="_Toc447728893"></a>Managing Trip Quotas</h1>
        <p>Managing a customer’s trip quotas is accomplished via the Quotas By Time field located on the Eligibility sub-tab in the Miscellaneous tab. Follow the steps below to learn how to manage trip quotas:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the ellipsis in the Quotas By Time field to display the Manage Trip Quotas screen:</li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>The left side of the screen allows you to select various trip limits.</li>
            <li>The right side of the screen allows you to select the days and times that the limits apply to.</li>
            <li>There are two categories of selection tools for trip limits:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Simple Selection Tools – these allow you to apply limits to days/times and leave unselected days unaffected. There are three options in this category:</li>
            <li>Any Number of Trips May Be Booked: There are no limits placed in these selected time slots. Selected cells under this option turn green.</li>
            <li>Limit Trips Booked To: Enter a max number of trips a customer can take on the selected time slots. Selected cells under this option turn yellow with the entered number displayed. If the entered number is zero, this is the same as No Trips May Be Booked.</li>
            <li>No Trips May Be Booked: You cannot enter trips in these time slots. Selected cells under this option turn red.</li>
            <li>Exclusive Selection Tools: These allow you to apply limits to days/times and exclude all other cells as indicated by the tool selected. There are two options in this category:</li>
            <li>Any Number Of Trips But Restrict All Trip Booking To Specified Time Frame: There are no limits placed on the time slots you select, but no trips may be booked in the unselected time slots. The selected cells turn green while the unselected cells turn red. </li>
            <li>Limit Trips Booked To: Enter a max number of trips a customer can take on the selected time slots. Then choose an option for whether or not to allow the trips in the rest of the cells. The selected cells turn yellow with the entered number displayed while the rest of the cells turn either green or red.</li>
            <li>The check box Violations Allowed with Supervisor Override allows trips to exceed the selected limit of trips after a supervisor override. This option adds an asterisk to all numbers within the yellow cells.</li>
            <li>When you are finished editing the customer’s quotas, save your work by clicking the Accept button.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is possible to use various combinations of these tools to create quite complex limit structures specifically geared towards each customer. Clicking on a day or a time will select all cells in the corresponding column or row. You should use the exclusive tools to create the general quota structure since they affect all the cells. Then, use the simple tools to tweak the structure to your liking.</p>

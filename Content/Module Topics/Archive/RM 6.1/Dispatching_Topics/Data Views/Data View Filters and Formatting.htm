        <p>Agencies with many vehicles in service at the same time may want to only show specific trips, trip types, or trips that are currently in a specific status. This can be done by creating a new data view with filter defined. For example, you can create a Wheelchair Trip data view that only shows those trips that are the Wheelchair mobility type.</p>

        <p>The Dispatching module can contain several navigation tabs on the bottom window. Only a single view can be viewed at a time, but several can be open and available to be accessed quickly. While opened, these views are updated ‘in the background.’</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1">
            <li>On the Dispatching toolbar, click the Data View button. Select Open to open a new data view, or select close, to close the currently active data view. If you are opening a view, the Data View Manager appears.</li>

            <li>The Data View Manager displays the data views available to you. Those marked as public are available to everyone in your agency. Those not marked public can only be used by you.</li>
            <li>The Trip Mode column is read-only and, if checked, indicates whether or not the data view is in Trip Mode. It will not switch the view to Stop Mode.</li>
            <li>Select the Data View you want to open. If you hold the Ctrl key and select multiple views, you can open views together.</li>
            <li>Click Open and Return to open the selected view or views.</li>

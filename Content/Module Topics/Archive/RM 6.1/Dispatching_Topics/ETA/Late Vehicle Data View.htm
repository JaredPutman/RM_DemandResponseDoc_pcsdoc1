        <p>Agencies with many vehicles in service at the same time may want to be notified when one of their vehicles is running late beyond a certain time limit. This can be done by creating a data view with specific filter and formatting properties configured. In the example below, the agency wants to know the Current Manifest Slack is -21 or beyond.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/Dispatching_Screenshots/Late Vehicle Data View.png" style="width: 588px;height: 338px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Notice that the value for Current Manifest Slack may be different than ETA (slack). This is due to the fact that Current Manifest Slack shows the value for the next stop in its manifest for all trips on the schedule.</p>
        <p>When properly configured, the tab flashes when new vehicles cross the time threshold and are added to the data view. You can turn off the flashing by right-clicking in the Data View Tab list.</p>

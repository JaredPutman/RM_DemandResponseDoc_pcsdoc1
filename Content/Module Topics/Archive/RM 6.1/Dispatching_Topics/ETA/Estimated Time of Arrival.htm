        <p>This feature is not like other features as there is no button or module used to access it. Instead, there are a few columns that you add to a dispatching data view to show you how close to schedule your vehicles are currently running. Remember that ETA works with live data and calculations are constantly being updated by changes you make in the Dispatching grid and from GPS coordinates sent in from mobile devices.</p>

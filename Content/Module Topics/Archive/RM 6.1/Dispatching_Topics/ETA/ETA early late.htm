        <p>This column compares ETA (actual) to a stop’s requested and/or appointment early/late window, depending on the trip’s timing preference. This is a measure of how the customer perceives the situation. The result is a color-coded number of minutes the trip is currently outside of that window. Note that the number will not normally match the value in the ETA (slack) column as the ETA (early/late) value is the time to or from either the early or late window, not the Stop Time.</p>
        <p>The driver is aiming for the currently scheduled time (Stop Time) but the customer is not necessarily aware of the scheduled time; they are only aware of the promised time window.&#160; ETA (actual) shows Dispatch how the driver is performing, while ETA (early/late) shows them the customer’s perspective.</p>
        <p>If a trip has a timing preference of Pick-up or Drop-off, the negotiated request window is around the Request Time, and ETA (early/late) will only appear that half of the trip. If the timing preference is Pick-up with Appointment, then the pick-up window is around the Request Time and the drop-off window is around the Appointment Time; ETA (early/late) appears for both halves of the trip.</p>
        <p>On the dispatching grid, this column is color coded to make it easier to view on-time performance at-a-glance.</p>

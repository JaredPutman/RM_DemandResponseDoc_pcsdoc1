        <p>Continuous Optimization is a feature in the demand-response Dispatching module that monitors trips and proposes new schedules if vehicles are running late, for trips that are or have become unscheduled, to fill in for cancelations, to schedule will-call trips, etc.</p>
        <p>This new feature must be turned on in the Settings module and can be run in semi-automatic or fully automatic mode. In semi-automatic mode, the user will have to accept any proposed schedules, while in fully automatic, the proposed schedule is automatically accepted.</p>
        <p>In order to use Continuous Optimization, you will need to have RouteMatch Question Service (RMQS) installed and ETA enabled. While not a requirement, Continuous Optimization is more useful with MDCs. MDC updates provide RSE (the RouteMatch Scheduling Engine, which runs Continuous Optimization) with the last known vehicle location, stop completion information, etc. Furthermore, schedule changes from Continuous Optimization are automatically sent to the MDCs as they occur. If your agency does not use MDCs, Continuous Optimization can still be beneficial because recommended scheduling changes are still displayed in Dispatching, allowing you to accept them and communicate the schedule changes to drivers.</p>

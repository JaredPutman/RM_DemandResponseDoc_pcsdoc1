        <p>If Continuous Optimization is set to fully automatic (in the Settings module), the proposed schedule changes will be accepted automatically and the following instructions are not necessary. The instructions below are for the semi-automatic mode of Continuous Optimization. See the RM#6.1 Administrator's Guide for more information.</p>
        <p>Step 1: Add columns to existing Dispatching data view or create new data view.</p>
        <p>There are numerous columns for Continuous Optimization; all of these columns begin with the Continuous Optimization Proposal prefix (COP_). There are a few that will be most helpful to a dispatcher because they show the important information about any proposed schedule: </p>
        <p>COP_Proposed Vehicle, COP_Proposed Run Name, COP_Proposed Stop Time. To see the information that Continuous Optimization used to create its proposals, you can also add the following columns: COP_Basis Vehicle, COP_Basis Run Name, COP_Basis Stop Time.</p>

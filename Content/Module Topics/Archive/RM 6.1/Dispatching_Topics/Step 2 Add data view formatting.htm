        <p>Step 2: Add data view formatting, if desired.</p>
        <p>You can use the COP_Proposed Validity Indicator field to format your data view. The COP_Proposed Validity Indicator field shows whether or not a new schedule has been proposed, the validity of the proposed schedule if one has been proposed, or whether the trip has been rescheduled. A proposed schedule may not be valid if another user has made changes to a trip between the time that Continuous Optimize began running and when the proposal was viewed in Dispatching. To differentiate between these states, the COP_Proposed Validity Indicator field has four possible values:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">None – There is no proposed scheduling change for this trip.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Optimized – There is a proposed change, and it appears to still be valid.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Suspect – There were changes to the trip that might affect how the trip should be scheduled since Continuous Optimize began running (for example, attendant count, address, load/unload time, etc.), but these did not include changes to the scheduled vehicle or scheduled pickup/dropoff times.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Rescheduled – There were changes to the trip that included either changing the scheduled vehicle or scheduled pickup/dropoff times.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">By assigning different formatting to each of these values, you can format your data view for ease of use.</li>
        </ul>

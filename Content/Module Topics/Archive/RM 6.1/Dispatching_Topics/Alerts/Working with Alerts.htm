        <p class="noteBottom">Please contact your RouteMatch representative about setting up alerts.</p>
        <p>Dispatching allows up to eight (8) alerts to be defined. These alerts allow a dispatcher to be notified when other dispatchers change or update data. You can filter and format on these alert fields just like any other field on the window. All of the alerts display as check boxes and can be defined to be editable or read-only. The purpose of these alerts is to notify the dispatcher when a specific piece of data has been updated. When the time of any trip changes, the alert field for that trip is turned on. The dispatcher can then define a filter in the data view to show trips with this alert field. Whenever a trip time changes, that trip will show up in the view. Alert fields display on the Dispatching window as shown in the following graphic.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Currently, there is no user interface provided to set up alerts. The alerts must be defined by directly entering data into two SQL tables. For more information on setting up the alerts, refer to the Dispatching Options chapter in the RouteMatch Administrator’s Guide.</p>

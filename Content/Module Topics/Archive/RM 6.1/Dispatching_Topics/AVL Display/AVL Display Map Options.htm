        <p>The Automatic Vehicle Locator (AVL) Display tab allows a dispatcher to locate their agency's vehicles on the map in real-time.&#160; The AVL map displays the vehicle's current location based on the GPS information reported by the agency's wireless devices.&#160; Vehicle icons appear on the map to indicate where the driver is on their route.&#160; These icons move on the map as the vehicles progress through the stops.&#160; This way a dispatcher can know where in their service area any vehicle is currently located.</p>

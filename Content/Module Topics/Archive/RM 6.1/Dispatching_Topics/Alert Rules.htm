        <p>The alerts are system-wide so all users have the same alerts defined. Once alert fields are named by the user, they are available in the Dispatching window. </p>
        <p>The alert mapping rules will always override you directly changing the alert. If you change data in a trip that will set an alert on and then turn that alert off in the same set of changes, the rule takes precedence. For example, if you have an alert turned on for Rider Count Change and you change the rider count again, turn off the alert, then select Save, the software will turn off the alert per your change, but when the updated rider count is saved the alert will be set back on according to the rule.</p>
        <p>These alerts only detect that a field has been changed by a user in the Dispatching module. There is no provision to set alerts based on who made the change or on how much the field value has changed. Only that a field has been changed from within the Dispatching module is indicated. </p>

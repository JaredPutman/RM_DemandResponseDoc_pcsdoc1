        <p>Step 3: Look for proposed schedule changes, using the COP_Proposed columns and formatting that you added to your data view.</p>

        <p>Step 4: Select the trip(s) that you want to apply the proposals for. You can select more than one trip at a time by clicking the trips while holding down the Ctrl key on your keyboard.</p>
        <p>Step 5: Click the Proposals... button on the Dispatching toolbar and select one of the options.</p>

        <p>A window pops up displaying how many trips will become scheduled, how many will be unchanged, how many have been changed (but not the scheduled vehicle or scheduled pickup/dropoff times) since optimization was run, and how many have been rescheduled since optimization was run. For trips in the last two categories, the schedule that is proposed may no longer be valid. You should check that the proposed schedule is still valid for these trips.</p>

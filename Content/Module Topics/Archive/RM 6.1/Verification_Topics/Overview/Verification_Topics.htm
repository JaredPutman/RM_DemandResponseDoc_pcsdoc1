        <p>The Verification module allows you to validate all of the information for the runs and trips provided to your customers. Verification can only occur after the trips have been taken by customers so the date must be set to a time in the past. If there are any missing runs or trips, they can be created and assigned to vehicles in this module as well. The majority of information presented in reports is drawn from the Verification module.</p>

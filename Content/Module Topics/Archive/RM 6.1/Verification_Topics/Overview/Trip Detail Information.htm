        <h2>Trip Detail Information Bar </h2>
        <p>Many of the tools associated with the Verification module allow you to add and change various pieces of information to insure that your reports are as accurate as possible.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The information on the trip detail bar is automatically updated every time a save with / without verification occurs. The software takes into account the settings you have established under the verification options and the information entered in the trip details each time the bar updates. Double check this information before saving with validation to make sure there are not any obvious mistakes. The fields of the information bar are defined as follows:</p>

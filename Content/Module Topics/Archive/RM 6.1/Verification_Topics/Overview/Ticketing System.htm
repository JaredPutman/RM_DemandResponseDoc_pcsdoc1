        <h2>Ticketing System</h2>
        <p>The ticketing system in the Verification module lets you to track and manage disputed trips and runs. This gives you the ability to bring attention to items that need to be reviewed by either management or separate providers. This can also include billing, trip, run, driver, or address issues.</p>
        <p>Providers can also view the tickets that have been assigned to them. This makes it easier to view only those tickets that are relevant to the provider and they are only able to add notes to the ticket, or accept the given dispute.</p>

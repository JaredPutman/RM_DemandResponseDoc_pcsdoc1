        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">True – This option means you must select a run first and then a vehicle associated with that run when performing verification. A run can have multiple vehicles associated with it. </li>
        </ul>

        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">False – This option means you must select a vehicle first and then a run associated with that vehicle when performing verification. A vehicle can have multiple runs associated with it. </li>

        <p>Be sure to save after selecting an option. When you make this change, you will probably have to close and restart RouteMatch before the change will apply. </p>

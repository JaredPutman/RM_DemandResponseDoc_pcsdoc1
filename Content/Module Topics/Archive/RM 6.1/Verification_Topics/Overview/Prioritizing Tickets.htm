        <h3><a name="_Toc447896357"></a>Prioritizing Tickets</h3>
        <p>An Exception Priority column appears in the Analysis Notes section of the Verification module, allowing you to prioritize validating tickets. You can classify validation by priority and view the different priority levels so you can quickly decide if you need to respond. These include:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Critical – Very important, mark as critical and needing verification.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Level 1 - Important, mark as needing a note for reason of dismissal.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Level 2 - Not required, mark as not needing verification to resolve.</li>
        </ul>

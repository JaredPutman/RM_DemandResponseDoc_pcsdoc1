            <li>Select an option for how the system should compute non-customer pay cost. The selection you make here determines the parameters you then need to define in the grid below. You have the following cost computing options:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 54pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Flat Fee Only – Charge a fixed amount for trips regardless of the miles or length of time traveled.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Flat Fee Only (Full Control) – This choice has the same parameters as the Flat Fee Only option, but you can override the corresponding funding sources’ Bill Attendant, Bill Guest, and Bill No Show settings.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Individual Miles and Explicit Time Interval – The amount charged for this billing rule is based on the miles and the exact length of time (down to minutes) traveled.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Individual Miles and Explicit Time Interval (Full Control) – This choice has the same parameters as the Individual Miles and Explicit Time Interval option, but you can override the corresponding funding sources’ Bill Attendant, Bill Guest, and Bill No Show settings.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Individual Miles and Hours – The amount charged for this billing rule is based on the miles and hours traveled.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Individual Miles and Hours (Full Control) – This choice has the same parameters as the Individual Miles and Hours option, but you can override the corresponding funding sources’ Bill Attendant, Bill Guest, and Bill No Show settings.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Individual Miles and Hours with Deadhead and Wait Time – The amount charged for this billing rule is based on the miles and hours traveled. This option also allows you to apply extra charges for deadhead and wait time.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Individual Miles with Independent Guest and Attendant Charges – The amount charged for this billing rule is based on the miles traveled. This option also allows to apply extra charges to guests and attendants.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Shared Ride – All passengers share the cost of the trip, which is based on the miles traveled. This option also allows for extra charges to be applied to guests and attendants.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Master Trip Cost Function – This billing rule is accessible from the Master Cost Billing Rule Attributes screen.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Shared Miles – All the passengers share the cost of the trip, which is based on the miles traveled.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Shared Miles and Hours – All passengers share the cost of the trip, which is based on the miles and hours traveled.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Shared Miles and Hours (Full Control) – This choice has the same parameters as Shared Miles and Hours, but you can override the corresponding funding sources’ Bill Attendant, Bill Guest, and Bill No Show settings.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Run Charge – This option allows you to define the various charges that can apply to runs. For example, the run fee, revenue hours/miles, service hours/miles, etc. can all be defined here. When creating a billing rule for runs, this is the only selectable option.</li>

        <p>The Description tab displays a definition of the computation and its corresponding parameters.</p>

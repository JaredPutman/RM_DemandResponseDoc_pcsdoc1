        <p>The Funding Sources module is used to create, edit, and delete funding sources for your agency. A funding source and its associated billing rule(s) are used when calculating trip cost for a customer. Various funding sources may be entered in this window, which may include insurance companies, health care institutions, or other funding types. At least one billing rule (usually more) must be created for each funding source.</p>

        <p>Create a new record for one of your agency’s services by defining each of its settings and assigning vehicle pools to the service. When using RouteMatch Scheduling Engine (RSE), the settings for the service will be in effect when scheduling trips that use this service. </p>
        <p>RouteMatch staff typically set this up during your initial implementation, but you may need to complete the steps below if your agency decides to add/remove/change a service.</p>

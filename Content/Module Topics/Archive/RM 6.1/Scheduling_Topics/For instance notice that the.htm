        <p>For instance, notice that the pickup for Dela Brown is scheduled at 8:21:25am, but if the vehicle were to leave the garage at the currently scheduled time of 12:00:00am, it is projected to be at this location 6 hours 50 minutes and 54 seconds early (“PE=6h 50m 54s”). Similarly, Andy Dyer’s drop-off at 8:30:00am is projected to be late by 29 minutes 17 seconds (“PL=29 17s”).</p>

        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">It is possible to have a trip both scheduled early (or late) and projected early (or late). Example would be Caleb Brown’s pickup at 8:27:12, which is both scheduled early (“SE=2h 2m 48s”) and projected to be late (“PL=1h 0m 39s”). This means that as currently scheduled, this trip is over two hours before the promised time window, and unless something changes, there is not adequate travel time to get to this pickup.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Unlike ETA, the projected early and late times do not carry over to the next stop, so if a stop is projected to be late, the very next stop could be projected on time or even early. It is simply a comparison of scheduled time vs. travel time for each stop.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Trips scheduled outside their time windows are rarely desirable, so any amount of scheduling early or late (SE= or SL=) deserves some evaluation.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Insufficient travel time is also undesirable, so any amount for predicted late (PL=) time deserves some evaluation.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">There is usually some amount of slack time even in the most efficient schedules, but the acceptable amount of excess travel time (slack) depends on your agency. So, vehicles projected to be early should be evaluated if the value for PE= is unacceptably large.</li>
        </ul>

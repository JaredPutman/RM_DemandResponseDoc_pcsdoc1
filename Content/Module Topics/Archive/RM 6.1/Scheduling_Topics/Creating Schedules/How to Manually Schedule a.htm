        <p>A scheduler can manually schedule trips to vehicles or runs without the assistance of the RouteMatch Scheduling Engine (RSE). In most cases, you will need to perform some manual scheduling in order to fully complete your schedules. There are many reasons why manual scheduling is required: some trips may be ignored by RSE, you might need to move a trip to a specific vehicle despite the system's recommendation, etc. Complete the following steps to manually schedule a trip:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="1">
            <li>Select a trip from the Unscheduled Trips sub-window. You can select multiple trips at once by holding down the Control or Shift key on your keyboard.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="2">
            <li>You have two options to place the trip on a vehicle:</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;margin-left: 51pt;" start="1">
            <li>You can select a vehicle and then click the Manual Schedule button on the toolbar. This automatically moves the trip to the vehicle.</li>
            <li>You can click and drag the trip over the vehicle and then release it. To drag, hold the right mouse button down while moving the cursor across the screen.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="3">
            <li>When you place a trip on a vehicle, you are presented with the following scheduling options.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 35pt;">
            <li>Schedule trip to vehicle for – [mm/dd/yyyy only] – Schedule the trip for the selected date only.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 35pt;">
            <li>Schedule trip to vehicle for the requested day forward – [(Day of the Week) only] – Schedule the trip for the selected date and for each of the selected days of the week forward. For example, schedule the trip for today and for all Wednesdays forward.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 35pt;">
            <li>Schedule trip to vehicle for the requested day forward – [All applicable days] – Schedule the trip for the selected date and for all applicable days forward.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noteTop" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #20b0e6;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">&#160;</p>
        <p class="noteBottom">The click-and-drag feature can also be used to make small, quick changes to your schedule. For example, if you notice a trip is scheduled to the wrong vehicle, click and drag it to the correct vehicle for an easy fix.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="4">
            <li>An arrow icon displays next to the trip to indicate that it has manually scheduled but the time was not yet accepted. The trip time for manually scheduled trips is set to the default established in the Settings module. Modify the trip time by right-clicking on the trip and selecting Time Edit. Refer to the Change Time for a Scheduled Trip section for more information.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="5">
            <li>To accept the time, right-click on the trip and select an Accept Time option.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="noteBottom">Selecting a Time Accept option only applies to recurring (standing order) trips. Demand response trips will always have Today Only as the selected option. If you schedule a trip for all days forward then the All Days options will be available for accepting the time of the trip. This also applies to exception trips. If you have an exception trip (one that was scheduled as part of a standing order, but this one occurrence of the trip was altered) you will only be able to accept the time for today only.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="6">
            <li>The trip is now scheduled to the vehicle or run.</li>

        <h2><a name="_Toc447186028"></a>Computed Travel Time</h2>
        <p>When manually scheduling a trip, your agency may anticipate scheduling it early or late in order to allow the customer to get the ride. The software allows you to easily identify the trips scheduled outside of their time windows by marking them Scheduled Early (SE) or Scheduled Late (SL) with the amount of time (early or late) for that trip’s pickup or drop-off.</p>
        <p>For instance, notice that the 8:27:12am pickup for Caleb Brown is well outside the requested pickup window of 10:30-11:00, as indicated as scheduled early with “SE=2h 2m 48s”. Also note that Dela Brown’s drop-off at 3:05:00pm is 5 minutes after the drop-off of 3:00:00pm, which is shown as scheduled late, “SL=5m”.</p>

        </p>
        <p>In addition when scheduling trips manually, it is sometimes necessary to provide more or less travel time than the automated system would normally compute via RSE. This excessive or inadequate travel time is now indicated as Projected Early (PE=) or Projected Late (PL=) with its associated times frames.</p>

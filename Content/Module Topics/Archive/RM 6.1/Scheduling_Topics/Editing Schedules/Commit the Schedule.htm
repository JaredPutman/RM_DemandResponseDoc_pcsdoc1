        <p>After you have created and adjusted your schedule, you can commit the schedule for a specific vehicle. Committing the schedule copies the schedule to the future dates selected. If there are items already on future schedules, RouteMatch attempts to reconcile the two schedules. If there is a conflict, the existing trips are left as-is and the new scheduled trips are not added. Exceptions are not copied to future dates.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="1">
            <li>In the Scheduled Trips area, select the vehicle(s) that you want to commit to the schedule. When viewed using Enhanced Manual Scheduling, click a vehicle in the Vehicle List area.</li>

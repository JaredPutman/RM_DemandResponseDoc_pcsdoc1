        <p>Trips can be canceled or deleted. Many agencies make the following distinction when it comes to canceled and deleted trips: A customer causes a trip to be canceled, while the agency itself deletes a trip. For example, if a customer calls to inform your agency that they will be missing a trip, it is canceled. If, however, the agency needs to remove an unneeded trip, it is deleted. Just be sure to follow your agency’s policy concerning cancellations and deletions.</p>

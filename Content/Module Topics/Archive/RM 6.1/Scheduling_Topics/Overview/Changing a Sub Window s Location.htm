        <p>You can move the sub-windows of the Scheduling module interface to different locations on the screen to better suit your workflow. To do this, click the top portion of the sub-window, hold the mouse button down, drag the sub-window to a new position, and release the mouse button. You can also change the sub-windows' sizes. To do this, mouse over the lines between sub-windows until the mouse pointer becomes a double-headed black arrow. Click and drag to a different size.</p>
        <p>To restore the default view, click the Views button on the toolbar and select Restore Selected Views from the drop-down menu.</p>

        <p>The Scheduling module’s interface is made up of several sub-windows. You are able to show or hide these sub-windows based on your need and method of scheduling. It is also possible to move the sub-windows into different positions. This section explains the various sub-windows, their use, and how to properly arrange the interface.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>Vehicles are listed by vehicle number and also display the pull-out date and time, as shown below. This information is in the format VN[MM/DD hh:mm], where VN is vehicle number, MM is month, DD is day, hh is hours, and mm is minutes. If your system is set up to allow scheduling to the second, it will be formatted as VN[MM/DD hh:mm:ss], where ss is seconds. See this Administrator's Guide to set up scheduling to the second.</li>

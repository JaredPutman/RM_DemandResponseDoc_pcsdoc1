        <p>This section describes the different ways to create schedules that your drivers can run. Before reading this, be sure you understand the process for creating trips, and how they are added to the system, how they are associated with customers, and why it is important that you have correct addresses in all of your trips. Your schedules depend on these things and the configuration options that your system administrator has configured in RouteMatch Settings. </p>

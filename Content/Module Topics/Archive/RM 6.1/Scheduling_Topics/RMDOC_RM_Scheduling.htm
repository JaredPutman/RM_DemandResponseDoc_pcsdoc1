        <p>Optimizing Without RSE Profiles</p>
        <p class="noteBottom">If you do not want to use this feature, you can optimize with and make changes to the Master Profile. This is the profile created from your existing settings when your system is upgraded, or created with ‘factory settings’ when first installed.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="6">
            <li>Select the optimization method from the drop-down at the bottom of the window. You have the following options:</li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <p>Note</p>
        <p class="noteBottom">If you have trips that are set as frozen trips, none of the optimization methods will have any effect on them.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Adjust scheduled trip times, maintaining stop order - Selecting this option will optimize the trips currently scheduled on the selected vehicles while maintaining the stop order of the trips on the vehicle. New trips are not added and existing trips are not removed from the selected vehicles.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Reorganize schedule, removing conflicting trips - Selecting this option will optimize the trips currently scheduled on the selected vehicles. The vehicles may have their stop order changed, conflicting trips removed, and no new trips added to the selected vehicles.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Remove current schedule and reoptimize - Selecting this option will remove any scheduled trips that are not on a run from their assigned vehicles and attempt to determine the most efficient use of the trips. This option will also attempt to add unscheduled trips to the selected vehicles.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Insert unscheduled trips where possible - Selecting this option will attempt to insert unscheduled trips on to the selected vehicles. This option will not make changes to the trips currently scheduled to the selected vehicles.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Advanced - Selecting the Advanced option displays more optimization options. The Advanced options are shown below with a brief description and you may select multiple options for the optimization.</li>

        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 54pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">Keep scheduled trips on same vehicles - Selecting this option will optimize the trips on the vehicles and not add any new trips to the vehicles, unless you also select "Attempt to insert unscheduled trips." All trips currently scheduled on the selected vehicles will remain on those vehicles, but possibly not at the same time as they were originally.</li>

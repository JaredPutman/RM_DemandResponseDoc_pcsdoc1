        <p>Drivers can also be scheduled to vehicles in the Scheduling module. It is possible to schedule multiple drivers to the same vehicle. It is preferred that the driver characteristics, vehicle profiles, driver available schedules, and driver properties are configured before scheduling the driver. The Schedule driver(s) for the selected vehicle icon is only active on the toolbar when a vehicle is selected in the Scheduled Trip sub-window. The Driver Scheduling window allows you to see a vehicle’s current trips, a list of drivers (ordered by suitability - with the most suitable driver on top), a display of the scheduled driver for the selected vehicle, and the driver’s available schedule. At the bottom of the screen, you can view the calculations and score for the selected driver.</p>

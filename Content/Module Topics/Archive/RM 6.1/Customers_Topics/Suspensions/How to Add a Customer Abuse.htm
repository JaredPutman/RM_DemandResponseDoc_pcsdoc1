        <p>You can record customer abuse records on the lower screen of the Suspension tab in the Customer’s module. </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="1">
            <li>Click the customer you wish to add an abuse to and navigate to the Suspension tab.</li>
            <li>Click New Item on the bottom half of the screen.</li>
            <li>Select a Service Abuse from the drop-down list.</li>
            <li>Select a Start Date from the drop down calendar and enter a Start Time for the abuse.&#160; </li>
            <li>Enter a Grace Period for the abuse. This is the number of days after the start date that the abuse takes effect.</li>
            <li>Select an End Date from the drop-down list and enter an End Time for the abuse.</li>
            <li>Enter any additional information in the Comment field.</li>
            <li>Changing the abuse points requires a supervisor’s override.&#160; Enter the supervisor’s information in the Overridden By field.</li>
            <li>If a supervisor changes the abuse points, the date of the change automatically displays in the Overridden On field.</li>
            <li>The amount of points assigned to the abuse is automatically valued at the default number defined in the settings. If you want an abuse to have a different number of points than the default, enter a value in the Points Override field.</li>
            <li>Select a Connotation for this abuse.</li>
            <li>Select the Object that created this abuse.&#160; At this time, trips are the only supported object.&#160; Click the field’s button to display the Abuse Points Object Search window, select Trip, enter the trip’s confirmation number, enter the trip’s date, and click OK.</li>

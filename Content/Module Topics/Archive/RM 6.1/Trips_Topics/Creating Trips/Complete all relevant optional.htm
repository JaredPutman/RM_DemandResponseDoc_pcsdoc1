        <div>
            <p class="Example">Jack McCoy calls your agency to request a new trip for Monday morning. In the Trips module, the call-taker locates Mr. McCoy's record, selects the appropriate date on the calendar, and then clicks the New button. Jack needs to be picked up at home and dropped off at his doctor's office so the call-taker enters the corresponding addresses.</p>
            <p class="Example">The call-taker determines which funding source Jack is using for his trip and then inquires about his timing preference. For this example, Jack needs to arrive at his doctor's office on time so he would favor a drop-off timing preference. The call-taker asks Jack what time he needs to be dropped off and configures the trip accordingly. Jack also has the following requirements, which the call-taker should note for the trip:</p>
            <p class="Example">Jack is able to walk without aid, so he has the Ambulatory mobility type.</p>
            <p class="Example">He is bringing a friend with him on the trip and this guest should be noted.</p>
            <p class="Example">Jack wants a ride back home after his appointment, so the call-taker should also create a return trip for him.</p>

        <p>Under certain conditions, it may not be possible to accommodate a trip during the time originally requested, so the agency can allow their call-takers to negotiate with the customer. You can manage and track this negotiation with RouteMatch's Trip Negotiation functionality. Trip Negotiation allows you to record both the initial time the customer requested as well as their final negotiated time. The following steps describe how to complete a typical trip negotiation:</p>

        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="1">
            <li>Enter the customer’s requested time in the Initial Request Pickup/Dropoff section.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="2">
            <li>Click Save on the menu bar and select the appropriate (LIMITED To Trips Module) option. You must save the trip before you can continue.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="3">
            <li>Click the Show Recommendations button on the menu bar.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="4">
            <li>Choose Negotiate trip times from the drop-down menu, which opens the Show Recommendations screen.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="5">
            <li>Select a vehicle from the list in the bottom half of the screen. These are the vehicles that fall within the initial request's time window, with the best recommendations appearing at the top of the list.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="6">
            <li>Confirm with the customer that the pickup/dropoff times, listed to the right of the vehicle, are acceptable. If the times are not acceptable, select a different vehicle.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="7">
            <li>Click the Schedule Trip button to fully save the trip.</li>

        <p class="ExampleHead">Example</p>
        <div>
            <p class="ExampleMiddleSection">An agency permits their call-takers to negotiate trip requests due to capacity constraints. A customer calls in and requests a trip pickup for tomorrow at 2:00 p.m. However, when the call-taker enters the initial request into the system, they realize there are no vehicles available at that specific time. The call-taker saves the trip limited to the Trips module and then runs Show Recommendations to find the customer's other options.</p>
            <p class="Example">The best result has the customer being picked up at 2:30 p.m. When the call-taker presents this option to the customer, they are happy with it despite the late pickup. The call-taker can then enter the trip's negotiated time and fully save it.</p>

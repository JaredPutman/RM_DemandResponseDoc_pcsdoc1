        <p>In order for a customer to take a round trip to a location and back, you must create two separate trips. As stated previously, this is because a trip constitutes one pick-up and one drop-off only. The Trips module contains an option that allows you to book a return trip by completing the following steps:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="1">
            <li>You must first create the customer's initial trip according to the directions above.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="2">
            <li>Select this trip from the bottom left of the screen and notice that the Return Trip button on the tool bar becomes active.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="3">
            <li>Click the Return Trip button and a new trip loads with the previous pickup and drop-off addresses switched. The rest of the trip’s information (funding source, service, etc.) remains the same.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="4">
            <li>Make any necessary changes needed for the new trip. For example, the customer’s timing preference might need to be changed along with their pickup/drop-off times. You can also make this return trip into a standing order, if needed.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="5">
            <li>Click Save on the tool bar and select a save option.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>

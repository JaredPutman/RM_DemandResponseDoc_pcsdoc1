            <li>Choose a Timing Preference for the trip depending on whether the pickup or drop-off is more important to the customer. There are five preferences to choose from:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 35pt;">
            <li>Drop-off – The customer has a specific time when they need to be dropped off but their pickup time is flexible. For example, the customer needs to be dropped off at work in time to start their shift.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 35pt;">
            <li>Pickup – The customer has a specific time when they need to be picked up but their drop-off time is flexible. For example, the customer needs to be picked up at work right when their shift ends.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 35pt;">
            <li>Pickup With Drop-off at Appointment Time – The customer has a specific time when they need to be picked up and dropped off in order to make an appointment. For example, the customer needs to be picked up at work right when their shift ends and they need to be dropped off at the doctor in time for their appointment. This option only applies to agencies that utilize the RouteMatch Scheduling Engine because it sets restrictions on the system's automatic scheduling functionality. Use this option only when it is necessary as the extra requirements give RSE fewer options for scheduling the trip.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 35pt;">
            <li>Drop-off Computing Pickup Time – Select this preference when negotiating trip times to define the customer’s desired drop-off time and have RouteMatch automatically calculate their pickup time. You must save the trip and perform Show Recommendations to fully utilize this functionality. This option provides the customer with more information, but the extra requirements give RSE fewer options for scheduling the trip. It may not be available if it is not configured for the selected service.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 35pt;">
            <li>Pickup Computing Drop-off Time – Select this preference when negotiating trip times to define the customer’s desired pickup time and have RouteMatch automatically calculate their drop-off time.

            <li>Enter the customer's desired pickup and/or drop-off time according to the option you selected in the previous step. The system then automatically calculates a window of time within which the customer can be picked up or dropped off. This window is defined by your agency, so changing its value is not recommended.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="noteTop">Note</p>
        <p class="noteBottom">If your agency negotiates trip times with customers, please refer to the Negotiating Trip Requests section below (page <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Trips_Topics/Creating Trips/Negotiating Trip Requests.htm#_Ref410640911" class="PageNumberOnly">1</MadCap:xref>).</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="8">
            <li>If the customer requires their pickup or drop-off to occur at an exact time, you can check the Exact? Checkbox to remove the time window option. You should confirm that your agency's operations allow for this kind of trip configuration.</li>

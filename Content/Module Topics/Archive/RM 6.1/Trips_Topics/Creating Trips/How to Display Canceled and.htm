        <p>When you delete or cancel a trip, it no longer appears on the screen. However, if you need to refer to a trip's record after it has been removed, you can do so by completing the following steps:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="1">
            <li>Navigate to the correct customer and select the date for which you would like to view canceled/deleted trips.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="2">
            <li>Click the Include Deleted/Canceled Trips button on the right side of the tool bar.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="3">
            <li>Canceled and deleted trips now appear on the screen. A trip with a red X has been canceled and a trip with a trash can symbol has been deleted.</li>
        </ol>

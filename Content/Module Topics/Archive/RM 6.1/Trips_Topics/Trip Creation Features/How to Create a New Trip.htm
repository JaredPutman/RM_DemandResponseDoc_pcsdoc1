        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="1">
            <li>You first need to locate and select the appropriate customer by browsing the list on the left side of the screen, or by using the search bar at the top. If using the search, you can select which criteria to use from the drop-down menu next to the search bar. For example, if a customer's name is not specific enough to find them (there might be multiple customers with the same name), you may want to use their social security number instead.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="2">
            <li>Select the Date of the customer's trip on the calendar. Please confirm it is correct to avoid creating the customer's trip on the wrong day. The date selected affects the number of trips the customer can take per week (if there is a limit) as well as their billing. The calendar displays the following items:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 35pt;">
            <li>The date you select is highlighted in gray.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 35pt;">
            <li>Today's date is circled in red.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 35pt;">
            <li>Dates that contain existing trips are bold.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="3">
            <li>Click the New button.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="4">
            <li>You should now complete all of the trip's required fields, which are indicated with a red arrow. First, select the addresses for the customer's pickup and drop-off. The customer's home address automatically displays in both fields, but you can change it to any GeoCoded address by completing a search. Notice that the system automatically calculates the trip's potential length (miles and minutes) in the Trip Estimate field.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="noteTop" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #20b0e6;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">&#160;</p>
        <p class="noteBottom">If the address you are looking for does not exist in the system, you may need to open the Addresses module and GeoCode it. Refer to the Addresses module's guide for more information.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="5">
            <li>Select a Funding Source for the customer’s trip, which the system uses to calculate the trip's cost. If the funding source you need is not in the list, click the Manage... button and select a funding source in the Customer Eligibility window. A customer's eligible funding sources are determined by your agency in the Customers module. Each funding source in the drop-down box has a symbol next to it:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 35pt;">
            <li>A green circle with a red check mark (<img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/Trips_Screenshots/How to Create a New Trip.png" style="width: 14px;height: 14px;" />) indicates that the funding source is currently applicable.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 35pt;">
            <li>A yellow triangle with a red exclamation mark (<img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/Trips_Screenshots/How to Create a New Trip_1.png" style="width: 15px;height: 14px;" />) indicates that the Standing Order's number of trips will exceed the customer's number of allowed trips, or the funding source will expire on a future date. This applies to Standing Orders only.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 35pt;">
            <li>A red circle with a white X (<img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/Trips_Screenshots/How to Create a New Trip_2.png" style="width: 14px;height: 14px;" />) indicates that the funding source has expired.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noteTop" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #20b0e6;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">&#160;</p>
        <p class="noteBottom">Your agency may configure RouteMatch’s settings to not allow you to book a customer’s trip if their funding source is expired. </p>

        <p>The Trip Planner enhancement provides you with an easy way to book trips that combine demand response and fixed route solutions. This creates a fixed route trip itinerary for the customer. Essentially, when a person needs to take a trip, the Trip Planner can be used to determine if there is a fixed route ride (possibly involving transfers on the fixed route system, since both stops might not be on the same route) that can handle this request.</p>
        <p>This gives you the option of offering the customer a fixed route trip as a less expensive alternative to an A to B demand response trip. It is also possible to combine the two and, for example, offer the customer a ride to the fixed route stop and do the same for the trip back.</p>

        <p class="noteBottom">If you do not see the Trip Planner button, it may not be activated in the Settings module. The "Trip Planner Button Is Visible In New Mode?" setting found under Trip Options must be set to True in order for the feature to be used.</p>

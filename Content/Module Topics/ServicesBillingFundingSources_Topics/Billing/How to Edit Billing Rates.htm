        <p>Billing Rates are the various charges that are contained in the parameters of a billing rule. To edit a billing rate, complete the following steps:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1">
            <li>Select a previously created billing rule from the list on the left. This loads the rule’s information into the window. The Billing Rates tab lists of all the parameters that include charges for this billing rule in the main part of the screen.</li>
            <li>Select a date from the drop-down calendar for when these changes should take effect.</li>
            <li>From this list, you can make changes to each parameter value to match the necessary charges for the billing rule. To do this, click the field and enter an amount or make a selection from the drop-down list. You can also click the ellipsis (…) next to the field to edit the value in a separate screen and apply a date range to it.</li>
            <li>When you have made all the changes, click Save on the toolbar.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>RouteMatch uses billing rules to calculate the expected customer pay and funding source cost when trips are saved and posted. The system also utilizes these rules when printing a driver manifest, when calculating customer pay on demand in the Dispatching module, and when verifying trips. In order to compute billing, you must define a rule’s cost, calculation method, and its associated trip details.</p>

            <li>On the toolbar, click the New button and choose whether this a new rule for trips or runs. This opens the Settings tab of the Billing Module.</li>

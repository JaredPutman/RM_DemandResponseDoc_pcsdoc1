            <li>You first need to create a billing rule that computes cost with the Master Trip Cost Function option.</li>
            <li>Click the Master Cost Attributes button on the toolbar to display the Master Cost Billing Rule Attributes screen.</li>
            <li>From this screen, select an RBE rule from the drop-down list. This list is made up of all the rules that have Master Trip Cost Function selected for how they compute cost.</li>
            <li>When you make a selection, the left side of the screen populates with a list of all the billing rules that have been created for your agency.</li>
            <li>This list is organized by: Funding Source-&gt;Billing Rule-&gt;Parameters in a collapsible list.</li>
            <li>Click a parameter from the list on the left and its details display in the box on the right.</li>
            <li>In the box, you can define a new value for this parameter, edit the existing value, or delete the existing value. If all the parameters are removed, their corresponding billing rule and funding source names turn red.</li>
            <li>Changes made to this window are saved automatically.</li>

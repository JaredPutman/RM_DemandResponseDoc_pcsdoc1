        <p class="Example">A transit agency offers one service for riders within the city limits and one for the suburbs outside of town. Trips for the suburb service are generally longer and can be more difficult to schedule than the city service. To account for this, the agency gives the suburb service a longer max trip time and larger PU/DO windows. These settings cause the software to treat the two service’s trips differently to match their typical operations.</p>

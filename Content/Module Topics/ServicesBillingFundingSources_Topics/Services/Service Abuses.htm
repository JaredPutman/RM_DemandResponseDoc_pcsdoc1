        <p>The Service Abuses tab allows you to associate abuses with your agency’s services. This way, you can keep a record of the number of times your customers misuse your service. No-shows and late cancellations are common examples of service abuses. Be sure to follow your agency’s policies when configuring abuses.</p>
        <p>You can also define a point value for each abuse, which the system utilizes for its automatic customer suspension functionality. The settings module under Customer Options is where you can create default points.</p>

        <p>The Trips module allows your agency's call-takers (or other staff) to create and manage your customers' trips. RouteMatch uses these trip records to create schedules and perform other tasks, so it is important that they are configured correctly. Typically, the customer contacts your agency to book a ride and explains the requirements for their trip. This usually includes their intended destination, what time they want to take the trip, and several other relevant pieces of information. The call-taker then configures a trip record for the customer that best suits their needs.</p>
        <p>Be aware that a trip constitutes one pickup and one drop-off only. This means that you must create multiple trips for a customer if they need to return home, or travel to more than one place.</p>
        <p class="ExampleHead">Example</p>
        <p class="Example">Mr. Smith calls your agency. He needs to visit his doctor, stop off at the pharmacy, and then return home. This requires the scheduling of three separate trips. First, the call-taker would need to create a new trip that takes Mr. Smith from his home to the doctor. Then, there needs to be another trip to take him from the doctor to the pharmacy. Finally, a third trip must be created to take Mr. Smith from the pharmacy back to his home.</p>

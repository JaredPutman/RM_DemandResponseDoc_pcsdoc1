        <p>Address the optional fields below according to your agency's policies and setup. Also, take into account the customer's needs to determine which fields are necessary when creating a trip. For instance, a customer's mobility type is usually important to note as they may require certain vehicle accommodations. Your agency might also require this information for reporting purposes. This section fully defines each of the optional fields and explains their typical use.</p>

        <p>A trip may require changes at some point between the customer's first request and when they actually take the trip. These changes may require a simple update to the trip's record or even the removal of the record completely.</p>
        <p>You can edit an existing trip and update its information, provided you are doing so for a future date. Usually, agencies do not allow edits for trips in the past because any discrepancies between the original trip record and what actually occurred in the field are accounted for in the Verification Module.</p>
        <p>Many agencies make a distinction when it comes to canceled and deleted trips. Typically, a customer causes a trip to be canceled, while the agency itself deletes a trip. For example, if a customer calls to inform your agency that they will be missing a trip, it is canceled. If, however; the agency needs to remove an unneeded trip, it is deleted. Just be sure to follow your agency’s policy concerning cancelations and deletions.</p>

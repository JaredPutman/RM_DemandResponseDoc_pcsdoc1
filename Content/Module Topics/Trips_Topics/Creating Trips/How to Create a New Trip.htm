        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="1">
            <li>You first need to locate and select the appropriate customer by browsing the list on the left side of the screen, or by using the search bar at the top. If using the search, you can select which criteria to use from the drop-down menu next to the search bar. For example, if a customer's name is not specific enough to find them (there might be multiple customers with the same name), you may want to use their social security number instead.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="2">
            <li>Select the Date of the customer's trip on the calendar. Please confirm it is correct to avoid creating the customer's trip on the wrong day. The date selected affects the number of trips the customer can take per week (if there is a limit) as well as their billing. The calendar displays the following items:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 35pt;">
            <li>The date you select is highlighted in gray.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 35pt;">
            <li>Today's date is circled in red.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 35pt;">
            <li>Dates that contain existing trips are bold.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="3">
            <li>Click the New button.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="4">
            <li>You should now complete all of the trip's required fields, which are indicated with a red arrow. First, select the addresses for the customer's pickup and drop-off. The customer's home address automatically displays in both fields, but you can change it to any GeoCoded address by completing a search. Notice that the system automatically calculates the trip's potential length (miles and minutes) in the Trip Estimate field.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="noteTop" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0175c0;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">&#160;</p>
        <p class="noteBottom">If the address you are looking for does not exist in the system, you may need to open the Addresses module and GeoCode it. Refer to the Addresses module's guide for more information.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="5">
            <li>Select a Funding Source for the customer’s trip, which the system uses to calculate the trip's cost. If the funding source you need is not in the list, click the Manage... button and select a funding source in the Customer Eligibility window. A customer's eligible funding sources are determined by your agency in the Customers module. Each funding source in the drop-down box has a symbol next to it:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 35pt;">
            <li>A green circle with a red check mark (<img src="../../../Resources/Images/Trips_Screenshots/How to Create a New Trip.png" style="width: 14px;height: 14px;" />) indicates that the funding source is currently applicable.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 35pt;">
            <li>A yellow triangle with a red exclamation mark (<img src="../../../Resources/Images/Trips_Screenshots/How to Create a New Trip_1.png" style="width: 15px;height: 14px;" />) indicates that the Standing Order's number of trips will exceed the customer's number of allowed trips, or the funding source will expire on a future date. This applies to Standing Orders only.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 35pt;">
            <li>A red circle with a white X (<img src="../../../Resources/Images/Trips_Screenshots/How to Create a New Trip_2.png" style="width: 14px;height: 14px;" />) indicates that the funding source has expired.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noteTop" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0175c0;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">&#160;</p>
        <p class="noteBottom">Your agency may configure RouteMatch’s settings to not allow you to book a customer’s trip if their funding source is expired. </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="6">
            <li>Choose a Timing Preference for the trip depending on whether the pickup or drop-off is more important to the customer. There are five preferences to choose from:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 35pt;">
            <li>Drop-off – The customer has a specific time when they need to be dropped off but their pickup time is flexible. For example, the customer needs to be dropped off at work in time to start their shift.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 35pt;">
            <li>Pickup – The customer has a specific time when they need to be picked up but their drop-off time is flexible. For example, the customer needs to be picked up at work right when their shift ends.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 35pt;">
            <li>Pickup With Drop-off at Appointment Time – The customer has a specific time when they need to be picked up and dropped off in order to make an appointment. For example, the customer needs to be picked up at work right when their shift ends and they need to be dropped off at the doctor in time for their appointment. This option only applies to agencies that utilize the RouteMatch Scheduling Engine because it sets restrictions on the system's automatic scheduling functionality. Use this option only when it is necessary as the extra requirements give RSE fewer options for scheduling the trip.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 35pt;">
            <li>Drop-off Computing Pickup Time – Select this preference when negotiating trip times to define the customer’s desired drop-off time and have RouteMatch automatically calculate their pickup time. You must save the trip and perform Show Recommendations to fully utilize this functionality. This option provides the customer with more information, but the extra requirements give RSE fewer options for scheduling the trip. It may not be available if it is not configured for the selected service.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 35pt;">
            <li>Pickup Computing Drop-off Time – Select this preference when negotiating trip times to define the customer’s desired pickup time and have RouteMatch automatically calculate their drop-off time. You must save the trip and perform Show Recommendations to fully utilize this functionality. This option provides the customer with more information, but the extra requirements give RSE fewer options for scheduling the trip. It may not be available if it is not configured for the selected service.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="7">
            <li>Enter the customer's desired pickup and/or drop-off time according to the option you selected in the previous step. The system then automatically calculates a window of time within which the customer can be picked up or dropped off. This window is defined by your agency, so changing its value is not recommended.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="noteTop" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0175c0;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">Note</p>
        <p class="noteBottom">If your agency negotiates trip times with customers, please refer to the Negotiating Trip Requests section below (page <MadCap:xref href="Negotiating Trip Requests.htm#_Ref410640911" class="PageNumberOnly">1</MadCap:xref>).</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="8">
            <li>If the customer requires their pickup or drop-off to occur at an exact time, you can check the Exact? Checkbox to remove the time window option. You should confirm that your agency's operations allow for this kind of trip configuration.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="9">
            <li>Complete all relevant optional fields. Keep in mind that a field may be optional in RouteMatch, but required by your agency. Each of these fields are explained in depth in the next section (page <MadCap:xref href="../Trip Creation Features/Optional Fields.htm#_Ref410635983" class="PageNumberOnly">1</MadCap:xref>).</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="10">
            <li>Enter information into the Appointment and Custom Fields tabs according to your agency's requirements and setup. These tabs are explained further below (page <MadCap:xref href="../Trip Creation Features/Appointments Tab.htm#_Ref410636012" class="PageNumberOnly">1</MadCap:xref>).</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 35pt;" start="11">
            <li>Click the Save button on the tool bar and select an option from the drop-down menu to save the trip. The available options are defined later in the Trip Saving Options section (page <MadCap:xref href="../Trip Creation Features/Trip Saving Options.htm#_Ref410636027" class="PageNumberOnly">1</MadCap:xref>).</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="ExampleHead">Example</p>
        <div>
            <p class="ExampleMiddleSection">Jack McCoy calls your agency to request a new trip for Monday morning. In the Trips module, the call-taker locates Mr. McCoy's record, selects the appropriate date on the calendar, and then clicks the New button. Jack needs to be picked up at home and dropped off at his doctor's office so the call-taker enters the corresponding addresses.</p>
            <p class="ExampleMiddleSection">The call-taker determines which funding source Jack is using for his trip and then inquires about his timing preference. For this example, Jack needs to arrive at his doctor's office on time so he would favor a drop-off timing preference. The call-taker asks Jack what time he needs to be dropped off and configures the trip accordingly. Jack also has the following requirements, which the call-taker should note for the trip:</p>
            <p class="ExampleMiddleSection">Jack is able to walk without aid, so he has the Ambulatory mobility type.</p>
            <p class="ExampleMiddleSection">He is bringing a friend with him on the trip and this guest should be noted.</p>
            <p class="Example">Jack wants a ride back home after his appointment, so the call-taker should also create a return trip for him.</p>

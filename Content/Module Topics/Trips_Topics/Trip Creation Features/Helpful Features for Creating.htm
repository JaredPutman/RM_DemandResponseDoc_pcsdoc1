        <p>RouteMatch offers a number of features that can help simplify and speed up the trip creation process. You should familiarize yourself with these features to improve your productivity and avoid redundant work. Most of the features detailed in this section have similar functionality, but they are intended for use in different scenarios.</p>
        <p class="ExampleHead">Example</p>
        <p class="Example">Amy Medina calls in and requests her weekly trip to the grocery store. The call-taker could navigate to the last date Mrs. Medina took the trip and use the Copy Existing feature to apply the trip to a new date. However, it would probably be faster to find the old trip with the Previous Trips feature. Also, if the Amy really does take this trip every single week, then it could be a good candidate for one of her favorite trips. This would help the call-taker save even more time.</p>

        <p>You have the following options when saving a trip. However, the available options that display in the drop-down depend on the trip you are creating, so you may notice some of the options below are unavailable on your screen. Be sure you select the correct options because each one has a different effect in the system.</p>
        <p class="noteTop" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0175c0;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">Note</p>
        <p class="noteBottom">The save options that limit the trip to the Trips module prevent it from displaying anywhere else in the application (e.g. Scheduling, Dispatching, Verification). Use this feature to save an incomplete trip and come back to it later, which is necessary when negotiating trip requests. Notice that trips saved this way are accompanied with warning text at the top of the screen. These options must be activated in the Settings module in order for you to use them.</p>

This option also allows the trip to be visible in other parts of the software (e.g. Scheduling), instead of just in Trips. Refer to the next section for more information on saving for selected days forward.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>After you save, the system automatically generates a confirmation number for the trip, which displays underneath the customer’s name at the top of the screen. The software also calculates the amount of money the customer owes for the trip based on the applicable billing rules.</p>

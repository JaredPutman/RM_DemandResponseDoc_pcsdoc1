        <p>This feature allows you to locate a trip the customer took in the past and create a new trip using the previous one's details.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to the correct customer and click New.</li>
            <li>Click the Previous Trips… button located next to the drop-off address field. The screen that appears displays a history of all the previous trips taken by the customer sorted by the number of times and how often the trips were taken.</li>
        </ol>

            <li>Select one of the customer’s previous trips.</li>
            <li>You can either transfer all of the trip’s information to the new trip (Select Trip) or just have the pickup and drop-off addresses transfer (Select Pickup/Drop-off Only).</li>
            <li>The Trips screen is then populated with the previous trip's information. You can now proceed with the trip creation process.</li>

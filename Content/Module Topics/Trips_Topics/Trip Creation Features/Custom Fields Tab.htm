        <p>The Custom Fields tab allows your agency to record any extra trip data that is not already covered by the other fields. For example, your agency could use this feature to record any of the customer's applicable health insurance numbers. In most cases, if your agency has taken the time to define these fields in the Settings module, you should pay close attention to ensure they are completed correctly.</p>

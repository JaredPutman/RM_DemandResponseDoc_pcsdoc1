        <p>This feature allows you to use a customer's previously-configured favorite trip as the basis for a new trip. Favorite trips are typically those that a customer takes often, so this feature can save you the redundancy of creating the same trip from scratch every time the customer needs to take it. A customer's favorite trips are assigned in the Customers module; please refer to the Customer's guide for more information.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to the correct customer and click New.</li>
            <li>Click on the Favorite Trips… button located next to the Previous Trips button. The Favorite Trips screen then appears.</li>

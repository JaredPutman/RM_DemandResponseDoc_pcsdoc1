        <h3 class="Heading3">Requested Trip Data Summary</h3>
        <p class="BodyText">There is a pop-up window that allows you to view a chart of requested trips organized by hour. This should give you a good idea of which times of day are going to be busy, so you can plan accordingly. On the toolbar, you can make the following changes to the data displayed in the chart:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>Filter which services and funding sources to include in the chart</li>
            <li>Set the auto-refresh timer</li>
            <li>Select which dates you want to view</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BodyText">Notice that the bar graph breaks up the trips by their wheelchair and ambulatory mobility types, and provides the totals of each in the bottom right.</p>

        <p>You can use the Map tab to view a trip's pickup and drop-off locations side-by-side on two integrated RouteMatch maps. The maps on this screen have the same controls as the maps located in other parts of the software (refer to the Map Controls User's Guide for more information). </p>
        <p>Notice that each map has a teardrop icon placed on it, which indicates the location of the pickup (on the left) or the drop-off (on the right). You can use this feature to gain a general understanding of how far the two locations are from each other.</p>

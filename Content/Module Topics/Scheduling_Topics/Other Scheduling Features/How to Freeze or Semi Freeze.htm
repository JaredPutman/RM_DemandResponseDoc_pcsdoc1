        <p>If a trip is frozen, neither its time nor its vehicle can be changed. If a trip is semi-frozen, its time can be changed, but it cannot be removed from the vehicle. A snowflake icon indicates that a trip is frozen. A half snowflake icon indicates that a trip is semi-frozen.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Highlight the trip you wish to freeze or semi-freeze in the Scheduled Trips area. When viewed using Enhanced Manual Scheduling, select the trip in the Enhanced Manual Scheduling area.</li>
            <li>Click the Freeze/Unfreeze button on the toolbar.</li>
        </ol>

        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Select an option from the menu that indicates the timeframe for which you want the trip to be frozen. You can choose to freeze or semi-freeze the trip for: Today Only, This weekday, All Applicable Days.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="noteTop" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0175c0;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">&#160;</p>
        <p class="noteBottom">If you schedule a trip for today only, you will only be able to freeze or semi-freeze the trip for "today only". If you schedule a trip for all days then the "all days" options will be available for freezing the trip. This also applies to "exception trips". If you have an exception trip (one that was scheduled as part of a standing order, but this one occurrence of the trip was altered, for example, it has a slightly different time) the same rule applies. You will only be able to freeze an exception trip for "today only".</p>

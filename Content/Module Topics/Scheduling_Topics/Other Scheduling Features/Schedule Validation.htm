        <p>Schedule Validation is a feature in the Scheduling module that allows you to find possible issues with a schedule. It does this by using a set of rules or criteria to check for items on the schedule that you may want to change. There are no default rules, which means that rules would have to be set up for your specific database. If you choose to enable Schedule Validation and do not have any rules set up, when you click on the toolbar icon in Scheduling, a pop-up will tell you that the schedule is valid, since there are no rules to cause a failure. In order to have rules implemented, please contact your RouteMatch representative. </p>
        <p>You can also click on an item that has been identified as breaking a rule, and RouteMatch will take you to the run, trip, stop, or break on which the rule was broken.</p>

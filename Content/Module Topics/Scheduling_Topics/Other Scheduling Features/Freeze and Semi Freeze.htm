        <p>When a trip is frozen, RSE will not move or modify the trip. It will stay at the same time and on the same vehicle. If the trip is semi-frozen, RSE keeps the trip on the same vehicle but the time can be adjusted as long as it is within the scheduled time window. Other trips may also be inserted provided there is space on the vehicle and the time window is adhered to. While RSE cannot change the scheduling of frozen trips, you can still manually unschedule, reassign, and edit the time of a frozen trip. Standing orders that are "center trips" are good candidates for the Semi-Freeze functionality.</p>

        <p>The driver score and the score calculations can be viewed at the bottom of the Driver Scheduling window. The driver score is based on the driver’s schedule availability, driver properties, and driver characteristics. The greater the driver score the more suitable the driver for the vehicle. The drivers are listed in the driver list with the most suitable driver at the top of the list. The calculations do not display unless the Show calculations check box is selected.</p>

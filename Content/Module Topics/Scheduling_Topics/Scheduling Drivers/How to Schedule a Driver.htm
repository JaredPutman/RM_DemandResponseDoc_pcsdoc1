        <ol>
            <li>Select a date and time from the tool bar.</li>
            <li>Select a vehicle from the list and then click the Schedule driver(s) for the selected vehicle button. This will display the Driver Scheduling screen.</li>
            <li>From here, select a driver from the list on the left. This list will be ordered based on the driver’s suitability for the selected vehicle.</li>
            <li>Click the <b>Schedule Driver for all Trip Times</b> button. This will display the Change Time screen.</li>
            <li>You may enter the start time and the end time of the driver’s schedule. You can type in these values or use the up and down arrows to change the time.</li>
            <li>Click the <b>Ok </b>button.</li>
            <li>On the Driver Scheduling screen, the selected block of time will be filled in green with the driver’s name displayed.</li>
            <li>If necessary, you can schedule more drivers to this vehicle.</li>
            <li>Click the <b>Save Driver Scheduling</b> button on the tool bar and select a save option.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Use this schedule for today [mm/dd/yyyy] only</li>
            <li>Use this schedule for today and all [day of week] in the future</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noteTop" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0175c0;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">Important Note about Driver Scheduling</p>
        <div>
            <p class="noteMiddle">If you select Use this schedule for today and all [Day of the week] in the future and a trip is then added to that vehicle for a later date that falls outside of the original time that the driver was scheduled, one Driver Manifest will be printed for the driver and one will be printed for the vehicle with no driver. If you add additional trips that fall outside of the schedule, you should adjust the driver schedule to make sure it contains the new trips for that vehicle.</p>
            <p class="noteBottom">An option to avoid this, is to schedule the driver on the vehicle for the full day, if you are certain you will be adding trips to the vehicle at a later time.</p>
        </div>
        <ol start="10">
            <li>The driver(s) name(s) will now appear next to the vehicle in the Scheduled Trips window.</li>

        <p>The Scheduling module allows you to build customer schedules manually and with the assistance of the RouteMatch Scheduling Engine (RSE). Within this module, trips and runs can be scheduled, unscheduled, canceled, and moved to suit your agency’s needs. Other features of this module allow you to view scheduled trip properties, customer trip information, maps with selected scheduled activity, and you can also print schedule-related reports. In addition, using the Enhanced Manual Scheduling view allows you to quickly modify the vehicle manifest in an easy to read calendar format. Driver scheduling is also covered in this guide.</p>

        <h1>Enhanced Manual Scheduling</h1>
        <p>The Enhanced Manual Scheduling sub-window provides an improved view for scheduled trips and has very similar functionality as the Scheduled Trips sub-window. You can still schedule trips with the Manual Schedule button on the toolbar or with the click-and-drag feature.</p>
        <p>The trips display as blocks along the sub-window's timeline instead of a list under the vehicle. This allows you to better visualize the schedule, as the size of each trip block corresponds to the length of the trip. Also, runs display along the side of the sub-window, so you can easily identify the trips currently assigned to the run. Enhanced Manual Scheduling provides the following features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Notice that the vehicles in the Scheduled Trips sub-window display with checkboxes when you activate Enhanced Manual Scheduling. You must click a vehicle's checkbox to display its schedule and assign trips.</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>When you click and drag a trip onto the sub-window, a preview of its block appears on the screen. This allows you to see the new trip's affect on your current schedule.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>You can adjust a trip's pick-up and drop-off time by dragging the top or bottom of the block up or down. Select the trip, click the white circle along the block's edge, and drag it to your desired time.</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>When you hover the mouse over a trip, text appears detailing the trip’s pertinent information. This is helpful when dealing with short trips as their boxes may be too small to read the information.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A run is a block of time on a schedule that is used for a specific purpose. For example, many agencies use runs to divide up work between their drivers. The trips contained within the runs are scheduled as a block on the same vehicle. You can schedule trips to a run using the manual scheduling steps explained earlier in this guide. You can also use RSE to automatically schedule trips to your runs. Then, you can use these same processes to schedule the runs to vehicles. If your agency does not use runs, you can skip these instructions.</p>

        <p>There are two methods for creating schedules, and you should use a combination of these methods to create your schedule.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Manual Scheduling – The scheduler adds all trips to runs or vehicles manually. </li>
            <li>RouteMatch Scheduling Engine – The RouteMatch Scheduling Engine (RSE) can recommend vehicles for single trips and can even automatically build entire schedules.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can schedule trips and breaks to the second by activating the appropriate setting. Refer to the RouteMatch 6 Settings Module User’s Guide for more information. </p>
        <p>The following is an overview of the scheduling process:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select a date from the calendar and a time range (if applicable).</li>
            <li>Schedule trips to vehicles.</li>
            <li>If your agency uses runs, create the necessary runs, add trips, and then schedule the runs to their vehicles.</li>
            <li>Schedule driver breaks.</li>
            <li>Adjust times of the scheduled runs, trips, and breaks, if needed.</li>
            <li>Commit the schedule, if applicable.</li>
        </ol>

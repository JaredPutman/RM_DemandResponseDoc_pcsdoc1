        <h2 class="Heading2">Cluster Analysis</h2>
        <p>The Cluster Analysis feature allows you to quickly identify trips that have the same pickup and drop-off address called Cluster Analysis. These clusters would normally be scheduled on the same vehicle however now you can manually remove trips from clusters or add trips to clusters if you find it appropriate to do so. </p>
        <p>To use this feature, you must have the semiclustering settings enabled under the profile that you are using for cluster analysis. These settings are highlighted below. Enabling semiclustering is required, however allowing for multiple services in semiclustering is optional (those items are unchecked and highlighted in yellow).</p>

        <p>RouteMatch's computer-assisted scheduling engine (RSE) helps you schedule trips automatically. The system takes into account the optimization tuning parameters configured in the Settings module, your agency’s service area, and trip data. RSE can help fit trips into vehicles that already have trips assigned to them. For agencies using deviated fixed routes, a setting can be turned on to allow RSE to adjust or flex the times of fixed route stops. Call RouteMatch Support to turn on this setting. RSE has two main tools:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Show Recommendations / Quick Recommendation – RouteMatch recommends a vehicle for an individual trip.</li>
            <li>Optimization Engine – A full optimization in which RSE recommends complete schedules for each selected vehicle.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Be sure to verify the pickup/drop-off data of the trips you are scheduling with RSE and that you are correctly applying Day Before, Day Of, Day After to the times.</p>

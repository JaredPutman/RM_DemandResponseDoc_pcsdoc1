        <p>A break is any time that the driver is not driving the vehicle or loading and unloading passengers. Breaks can be scheduled for restroom breaks, refueling stops, meals, etc. It is also possible to schedule breaks while passengers are still on the vehicle. Breaks need to be created before running RSE so that trips can be scheduled around them.</p>

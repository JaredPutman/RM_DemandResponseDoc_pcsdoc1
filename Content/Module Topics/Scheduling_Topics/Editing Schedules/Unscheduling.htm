        <p>If you make a mistake or need to reschedule a trip or run, you can remove the them from their vehicle and back to the Unscheduled Trips or Runs sub-windows. Your options when unscheduling an item are very similar to the scheduling options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Unschedule trip for – [mm/dd/yyyy only]</b> – Unschedule the trip for the selected date only.</li>
            <li><b>Unschedule trip for this day forward – [(Day of the Week) only]</b> – Unschedule the trip for the selected date and for each of the selected days of the week forward. For example, unschedule the trip for today and for all Wednesdays forward.</li>
            <li><b>Unschedule trip for this day forward – [All applicable days]</b> – Unschedule the trip for the selected date and for all applicable days forward.</li>
            <li><b>Advanced </b>- This opens the Advanced unscheduling window which allows you to unschedule all trips or standing orders from your currently selected date and time range. You also have the option of unscheduling all Frozen trips.</li>
        </ul>

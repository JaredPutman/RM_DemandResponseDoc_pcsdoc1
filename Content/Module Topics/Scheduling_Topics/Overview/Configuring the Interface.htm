        <p>Configuring the Scheduling Module's interface involves selecting the sub-windows you wish to see and arranging their position on the screen. You can access the majority of the Scheduling module’s interface options with the Views drop-down on the tool bar. From here, you can show or hide the module’s sub-windows, determine the map’s zoom behavior, and control the display of your agency’s fixed routes on the map. The following list explains each of the View options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Scheduled Trips Window</b> – Select to show or hide the Scheduled Trips sub-window.</li>
            <li><b>Enhanced Manual Scheduling Window</b> – Select to show or hide the Enhanced Manual Scheduling sub-window..</li>
            <li><b>Unscheduled Runs Window</b> – Select to show or hide the Unscheduled Runs sub-window. </li>
            <li><b>Unscheduled Trips Window</b> – Select to show or hide the Unscheduled Trips sub-window. </li>
            <li><b>Restore Selected Views</b> – Select to return all the sub-windows to their default positions.</li>
            <li><b>Map Window</b> – Select to show or hide the Map sub-window. </li>
            <li><b>Audit Log Window</b> – Select to show or hide the Audit Log sub-window.</li>
            <li><b>AutoZoom Map</b> – Select this and the map will automatically zoom to the trip or route each time you select one. </li>
            <li><b>Smart Map</b> – Select this to allow the map to redraw itself only when necessary. This option will cut down on lag during the scheduling process as the map redraw process usually takes a few seconds to complete.</li>
            <li><b>Manual Map</b> – Select this and the map does nothing automatically. Any changes to the map view must be completed by hand.</li>
            <li><b>Show Route Lines</b> – Display your agency’s fixed routes on the Map sub-window. The Map sub-window must be active to view the routes and this option is required for printing driver directions.</li>
            <li><b>Refresh Route</b> – Select this option to update the route displayed on the map to include any changes.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Enhanced Manual Scheduling sub-window is an alternative view of the Scheduled Trips sub-window. It displays all scheduled activity for the vehicles selected from the Vehicle List in a calendar format. You can display up to 8 vehicles at a time. Enhanced Manual Scheduling can help you visualize the schedule with the following display features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Calendar view breaks down the vehicle manifests into 15-minute intervals.</li>
            <li>Runs are displayed as a strip along the left side of the calendar for each vehicle.</li>
            <li>Trips and breaks are displayed at the times they occur on the calendar.</li>
            <li>Times before garage pull-out and after garage pull-in are shaded in blue.</li>
        </ul>

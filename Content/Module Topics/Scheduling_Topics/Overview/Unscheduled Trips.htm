        <p>The Unscheduled Trips sub-window lists all of the trips that have not been scheduled. The trips appear with the pick-up and drop-off times originally configured for the trip. These times can be adjusted manually or by using the computer assisted scheduling function. Trips appear in expandable lists and are sorted into Standard and Will Call groups. Will Call trips are not typically scheduled in advance. Within either of these groups, you are able to further sort unscheduled trips by selecting an option from the Group By drop-down menu.</p>

        <p>There are a number of grouping options at your disposal and they are based on a variety of trip characteristics. You should select the option that works best for you. For example, you can group the trips based on the customer’s mobility type in order to make sure your wheelchair riders are properly accommodated.</p>

        <p>The Scheduled Trips sub-window displays all scheduled activity for the selected date and timespan. The scheduled trips, runs, and driver breaks display under their respective vehicles. Click the plus sign next to a vehicle to view its corresponding items. You can also click the plus sign next to a run (if used) to view the run’s trips. If you are using Fixed Route and Demand Response together, you will see fixed route trips and runs in the same window as the demand response. You can adjust the times and assigned vehicles for each of these items in this sub-window as the need arises. </p>

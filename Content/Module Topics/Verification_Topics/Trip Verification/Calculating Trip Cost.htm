        <p>This function allows you to calculate the trip cost for trips, vehicles, or runs, those saved with validation, and those not marked verified. This process takes into account each customer’s billing rules and all the information entered during the verification process. Be sure to complete verification correctly and save the information with validation before calculating costs. If any of the trip information is changed, you must save it again to keep the calculation accurate. Trip cost can be calculated for an individual vehicle or for all the vehicles of a date range. You can also calculate costs for trips for individual or multiple selected vehicles. </p>

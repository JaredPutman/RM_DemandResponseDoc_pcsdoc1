            <li>Select the <b>Vehicle Pool</b> that contains the vehicle that performed the run. </li>
            <li>The Run Summary Grid displays all of the runs that were performed on the Active Date. </li>
            <li>If you want to further filter the list, click the <b>Run Search</b> drop-down to select a specific run in the selected vehicle pool. The selected run appears highlighted in the grid. </li>
            <li>You can also limit the list to those runs that match the Verified Status filter. This lets you show all runs, only those that are verified, those not verified, and those that have trips with exceptions. </li>

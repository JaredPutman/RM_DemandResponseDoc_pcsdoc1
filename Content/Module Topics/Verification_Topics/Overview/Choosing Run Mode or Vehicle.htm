        <h2>Choosing Run Mode or Vehicle Mode</h2>

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>True – This option means you must select a run first and then a vehicle associated with that run when performing verification. A run can have multiple vehicles associated with it. </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>False – This option means you must select a vehicle first and then a run associated with that vehicle when performing verification. A vehicle can have multiple runs associated with it. </li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <p>Be sure to save after selecting an option. When you make this change, you will probably have to close and restart RouteMatch before the change will apply. </p>

        <p>To verify a run, you must first enter the correct run summary information and then validate all the corresponding trip details. Do this by completing the following steps:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Verification_Screenshots/How to Verify a Run.png" style="visibility: visible;width: 658px;height: 125px;" />
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select a date from the drop-down calendar. This must be a day in the past, as the runs must have already been completed before their information can be verified.</li>
            <li>Select a run and a vehicle from the drop-down boxes. The order you do this in depends on the Stop Mode setting you chose earlier. The key symbol <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Verification_Screenshots/How to Verify a Run_1.png" style="visibility: visible;width: 19px;height: 15px;" /> allows you to apply filters to the runs/vehicles that appear in the first drop-down box. Filters are defined in the settings under Verification Options.</li>
            <li>To avoid errors, go through the list of trips that appear in the Verification grid and make sure this list is complete. If trips need to be moved or created, refer to the Other Verification Tasks section of this user’s guide for a full explanation of these processes. </li>
            <li>Select the funding source for the run, if one applied.</li>
            <li>Select which of your drivers carried out the run.</li>
            <li>Select an override for the run, if one applied.</li>
            <li>Enter any additional charges applied to the customer for the run. There must already be a billing rule created that bills by run charge; otherwise, any information entered into this field will cause an error.</li>
            <li>Verify all trip data. Go over each trip for the run and make sure all the information is correct. If your company uses MDCs, most of this information should populate automatically. There will still be several fields that you will need to fill out by hand (e.g. No Show, Cancellation, Odometer Readings, etc.). </li>
            <li>Click the box in the Completed column when you have verified the corresponding trip.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="noteTop" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0175c0;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">&#160;</p>
        <p class="noteBottom">If you select completed for the pickup or drop-off, you must also manually select completed for the opposite leg of the trip. This is not the case for no shows and cancellations as these relate to the entire trip, not one leg or the other.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Click <b>Save Without Validation</b> as you go along to keep track of your work.</li>
            <li>The run summary is automatically calculated based on trips assigned to the run. If you need to make adjustments to the data, make the changes in the trip entry itself. </li>
        </ol>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Date </b>– You need to fill out this information only if you have the Show Date button activated. For each of the options, select whether they occurred on the current date you have selected, the day before, or the day after. If you choose the day before or the day after, the run must span midnight.</li>
            <li><b>Time </b>– Enter what time each of these occurred. The first button next to each box enters the current time and the second button resets the box to the original time.</li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:keyword term="Odometer">&#160;</MadCap:keyword><b>Odometer</b> – Enter the odometer reading of the vehicle that made the run for each of the options.</li>

            <li>Double check the following before saving with validation to minimize mistakes:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Do the four run/trip times make sense? They should look like this:</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Run Start (Earliest) -&gt; First Pickup -&gt; Last Drop-off -&gt; Run End (Latest)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do the four run/trip odometer readings make sense? They should look like this:</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Run Start (Smallest) -&gt; First Pickup -&gt; Last Drop-off -&gt; Run End (Largest)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Are there any abnormally high values in the Guests column?</li>
            <li>Are there any abnormally high values in the Attendants column?</li>
            <li>Are all the trips marked as No Show or Cancellation correct?</li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="13">
            <li>Click <b>Save With Validation</b> when all of this information is correctly entered. This saves all data into the correct tables for use in reports.</li>
            <li>Repeat these steps for each of the runs on your selected date. </li>
            <li>Verified runs appear with a red mark next to the vehicle name/number.</li>

        <p class="noteBottom">The software actually checks the times and odometer readings automatically when you save with validation. If a mistake is found, an alert will display with details and all problem fields will be written in red.</p>

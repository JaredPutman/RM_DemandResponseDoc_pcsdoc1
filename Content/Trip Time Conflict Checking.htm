        <h1>Trip Time Conflict Checking</h1>
        <p>RouteMatch can inform a user that the trip they are creating conflicts with one of the customer's existing trips. For example, say a customer already has a trip booked for 9:00am-10:00am on Thursday. If you attempt to create another trip for 9:30am, then an alert displays informing you that the new trip conflicts with the existing trip. This alert requires a supervisor's override in order to complete the trip booking.</p>

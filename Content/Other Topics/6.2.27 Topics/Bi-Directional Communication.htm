        <h3>Bi-Directional Communication</h3>
        <p>This version of RouteMatch contains the initial release of the Bi-Directional Communication (BDC)&#160;system. Please contact your account manager if you are interested in BDC.</p>
        <p>As a demand response dispatcher, BDC allows you to verbally communicate with your agency's drivers  to help resolve any issues that occur during service. For example, if a driver reports a no-show, you may want to call them to confirm they are at the proper pick-up location. This solution contains the following features:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li><b>BDC&#160;Calls</b> - Calls between a dispatcher and a driver. Both parties must press a button in order to speak and then release it to hear the other person.</li>
            <li><b>Broadcast Calls</b> - Announcements from the dispatcher that broadcast over the external speaker found on a vehicle. These calls can be made to one driver, or several at once.</li>
            <li><b>Covert Alarms</b> - Alerts triggered by the driver to inform you of a emergency situations on their vehicle.</li>
            <li><b>Event Records</b> - Reports to note any necessary details of a BDC&#160;call that members of your agency may need to refer to in the future.</li>
            <li><b>Voice Recording</b> - The ability to record the calls between dispatchers and the drivers for future reference.</li>
        </ul>

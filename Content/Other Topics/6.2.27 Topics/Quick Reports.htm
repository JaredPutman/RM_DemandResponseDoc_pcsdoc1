        <h3>Quick Reports</h3>
        <p>The Quick Reports feature in the Reporting module has the following enhancements in this version:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Freeze Columns</b> - You can freeze a set of columns in a report so that they stay still when you scroll the report to the right/left. To freeze columns, right-click on one and select the <b>Freeze Column </b>option. That column and any to the left of it will not move when you scroll the report to the right or left. You can then right-click and select the <b>UnFreeze Column</b> option to make the columns move again.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Open Existing Adhoc Reports</b> - You can now open any existing ad-hoc reports in the Quick Reports window. Do this by selecting the report from the left side of the screen. Note that the report's filtering, formatting, etc. will not display in Quick Reports (just the data).</li>
        </ul>

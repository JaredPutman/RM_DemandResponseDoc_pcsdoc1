        <h3 class="Heading3">Quick Reports</h3>
        <p>The Quick Reports feature is designed as a simple and fast way to create your own reports. These reports display in a separate window, so you can keep them open for reference and continue to work in RouteMatch (you can even move it onto your second monitor if you have one). Complete the following steps to run a Quick Report:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_1">
            <li class="keepWnext">In the Reporting module, click the Adhoc drop-down on the toolbar and select Quick Report.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/6.2.26 Screenshots/QuickReportToolbarButton.jpg" class="ImageStepkeepWnext" />
        </p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_1" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li class="ListParagraph">The Quick Reports screen then appears. Notice that it automatically displays a report of today’s trips. To create a new report, select a report type from the left side of the screen and double-click it, or click <span class="span_1">New </span>on the toolbar.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/6.2.26 Screenshots/QuickReportNew.jpg" class="ImageStep" style="width: 532px;height: 293px;" />
        </p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_1" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li class="keepWnext">You then need to select the report’s fields from the screen that appears. You can browse the list on the left and double-click a field to add it to the report. The Find bar at the top of the screen allows you to search for a field, and the Type drop-down lets you display a specific category of fields. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/6.2.26 Screenshots/QuickReportFieldSelection.jpg" class="ImageStepkeepWnext" style="width: 358px; height: 336px;" />
        </p>
        <p class="IndentStep">You can also add a field to the report using the keyboard. Highlight the field using the arrow buttons and then press the Enter button to add it.</p>
        <ol start="4" class="ol_1">
            <li class="ListParagraph">Once you add your needed fields, click the Apply button at the bottom of the screen. Your report then displays.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Live Filtering </h4>
        <p class="BodyText">There is a field at the top of each column that allows you to apply a filter to the quick report. To use this feature, enter your filter text into the field and then select an option from the field’s drop-down menu. The report then filters to display your desired results.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/6.2.26 Screenshots/QuickReportLiveFilter.jpg" />
        </p>
        <p class="BodyText">For example, say you are viewing a Customer report, and you only want to view the customers that live in a specific zip code. You can enter that zip code into the field at the top of the Zip column and then select Equal from the drop-down menu. The report then displays only those customers who live in that zip code.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Grid Layout</h4>
        <p class="BodyText">The Grid Layout tab at the top of the screen provides you with several options for configuring the data displayed in the report. These options include:</p>
        <p class="BodyText">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/6.2.26 Screenshots/QuickReportGridLayoutToolbar.jpg" />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">Group by Box – Allows you arrange the report into groups based on specific columns. For example, you can group a Trip report by service by dragging the Service Name column into the Group By box.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">Filter Panel – Allows you to apply filters to the report. Build a filter by selecting a column, a modifier, and entering the appropriate text. For example, a Customer report with a filter of “Zip Equals 30068” displays only those customers who live in the 30068 zip code.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">Column Format – Allows you to change the format of a column. For example, you can change a date column to display the long date (Thursday, August 18, 2016) or the short date (8/18/2016).</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">Column Summary – Allows you to summarize a column’s rows. For example, you can apply an average summary to the “Trip Estimated Distance” column to find out how long your trips typically are.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Saving Reports</h4>
        <p class="BodyText">Click this button (found on the toolbar) to save your report and view it later. Complete the following steps to save a report:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_1">
            <li class="BodyText">Click the Save button on the toolbar.</li>
            <li class="keepWnext">On the screen that appears, enter a folder to place it under, enter a name for the report, and a description for it.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/6.2.26 Screenshots/QuickReportSave.png" class="ImageStepkeepWnext" />
        </p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_1" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li class="ListParagraph">Click Save. This report then appears in the Saved Reports tab under the folder you entered in the previous screen.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Exporting and Printing Reports</h4>
        <p class="BodyText">You can export a quick report in order to keep a copy of it on your computer for later reference. To do this, click the Export to File button on the toolbar. Then, enter a name for the file, select where to place it on your computer, and then click the Save button. This saves the report as an excel spreadsheet file.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/6.2.26 Screenshots/QuickReportExportOptions.jpg" />
        </p>
        <p class="BodyText">You can also print out a physical copy of the report by clicking the Print button on the toolbar.</p>
        <p class="noteTop" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0175c0;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">&#160;</p>
        <p class="noteBottom">The exported/printed report contains the fields you have displayed in the Quick Reports screen. So, if you filter out certain rows, they will also be absent in the excel spreadsheet when you export the report.</p>

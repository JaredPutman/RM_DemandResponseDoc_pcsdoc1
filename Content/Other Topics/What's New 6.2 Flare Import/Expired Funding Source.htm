        <h2 class="Heading2">Expired Funding Source</h2>
        <p>A new setting to not add a trip when the funding source eligibility has expired has been added. If set to false, you are prompted with the window of “Funding source expired, unable to book for this funding source.” If set to true, you are prompted with “Funding source expired, book anyway?” This is found in Settings &gt; Trip Options &gt; Allow Trip To Be Created With Expired Funding Source. In addition, inactivating a customer cancels both the customer’s trips and now their stranding orders as well.</p>

        <h2 class="Heading2">RMLink Enhancements</h2>
        <p>The following features are new to the RMLink Message Center starting in #6.2.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Increased Character Send Text Limit</h3>
        <p>A new variable has been added to the GPS section in the settings module, RMLink sending message length limit. The default value is set to 250 characters in length.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/6.2 Import Images/RMLink Message Length Setting.jpg" />
        </p>
        <p>When typing a message in the dispatching send message box, the maximum characters allowed is based on this setting. If there is no number or the setting is not available, the default value is 120 characters.</p>

        <p class="noteBottom">Different devices have different limitations on the amount of text that can be viewed.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Format and Filter</h3>
        <p>The RMLink Message Center now allows you to format, filter and create custom dataviews. This new look matches other grids found in the application. When editing the dataview, you can now change color priorities in the formatting tab or add how messages are filtered in the filtering tab. In addition, checkboxes have replaced the “*” indication of a read message in the message center grid. The types, message or command, are also shown as text in the Kind column (MSG or CMD).</p>

        </p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Send Messages to Vehicle Pools</h3>
        <p>Now you can send a message to all vehicles belonging to a vehicle pool, either individually or as group. This is selected from the toolbar grid for Active Devices.</p>

        </p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Edit Canned Message text</h3>
        <p>Dispatchers are now able to edit text of canned messages from the Send Message window in the dispatching module. When they select a canned message from the drop-down, its text displays in the box below. The dispatcher can then make changes to this text.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Filter by Run </h3>
        <p>You can now filter the messages by their corresponding runs by opening the Run tab in the Message Filter pane.</p>
